Daddy!!!, as I call you. You have been more than a father to me and everyone around you. Your show of love, care and concern for me and all other youths cannot be taken for granted. I remember when you came in just came to Jos in 2007, you kept emphasizing that we students should and would not fail.Â  That word followed me to my WAEC class and when it was obvious I was going to fail maths in WAEC, I held on to that word. "My daddy has said that I can not fail". Fortunately when the result was out, I passed with a Credit. This was the beginning of numerous miracles that God used you to perform in my life.

One which is most prominent, was when I was confused, depressed and battered. I was in that state wanting to leave Jos. I remember your word to me those periods. You made me stay back and today I am very happy that God used you to grant me direction. I am better off and happy that I listened to your counsel to stay back. I can go on and on.

Daddy I must make you know that you are cherished, not by me alone but all who have come in contact with you in one way or the other. As today marks a new year for you, my sincere prayer is that God should take you beyond the pedestal you desire.

May he take you beyond places of honour you have ever imagined, may your ministry flourish and blossom like Aaron's rod, may the Almighty hand of the most High continually be your stay. May God's Grace and anointing on you never run dry. May all that you desire receive accelerated attention, may the ministry in your hands grow from strength to strength, Power to Power and Grace to Grace in Jesus Christ name!!! Amen.

I love and Cherish you my beloved Daddy, and Pastor. God bless you for all you do for us.
